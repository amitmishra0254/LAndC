Class Employee {

	string name;

	int age;

	float salary;

	public : string getName();

	void setName(string name);

	int getAge();

	void setAge(int age);

	float getSalary();

	void setSalary(float salary);
};

Employee employee;

Is 'employee' an object or a data structure? Why?


Answer: In the above example, the employee is an instance of the Employee Data Structure class, which means it is a Data Structure. We can see that the class "Employee" contains some getters and setters, like setName and getAge. These methods can be used to access and modify the data for a particular instance.
